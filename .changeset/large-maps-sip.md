# What is express-trail?

Consider having an advanced partner for your Express app, similar to [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) but with a greater focus and depth. Our request logger enhances your app! Think of it as a thorough investigator that not only records requests but also provides insights into the performance of middlewares, routes, and even the finer details of your app. By meticulously monitoring and analyzing requests, responses, and execution, you'll possess a powerful tool to optimize your app for superior speed and efficiency.
